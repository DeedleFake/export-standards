Export Standards
================

This is a tiny little project designed to parse an HTML file saved from an NSG Standards Registry search and convert it into a CSV file for more easily importing into a spreadsheet. It runs entirely in the browser. To access the app, visit https://deedlefake.github.io/export-standards.
